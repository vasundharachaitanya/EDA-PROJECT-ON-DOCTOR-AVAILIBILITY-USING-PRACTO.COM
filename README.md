# THIS PROJECT IS REGARDING ANALYSIS ON DOCTOR AVAILIBILITY USING PRACTO.COM WEBSITE.
  WE DID THIS PROJECT AS A TEAM OF TWO MEMBERS.
  FIRST WE HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA USING PRACTO.COM WEBSITE BASED ON OUR REQUIREMENTS BY RIGHT CLICKING PERTICULAR DATA AND INSPECTED THAT AND PARSED THE HTML CODE.
  WE TOTALLY SELECTED SEVEN CITIES AND SEVEN  DOCTOR_SPECIALIZATIONS TO SCRAPE THE DATA. 
  LIKE THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE DATA WHATEVER WE NEED.
  WE HAVE COLLECTED TOTALLY 2856 ROWS AND 11 COLUMNS AS RAW DATA.
  AFTER THAT WE HAVE CLEANED THE DATA WHATEVER UNWANTED DATA IS THERE BY USING MODE AND MEAN TO FILL THE NULL VALUES.
  AFTER CLEANING THE DATA WE HAVE COLLECTED TOTALLY 1065 ROWS AND 11 COLUMNS.
  AFTER THAT WE HAVE EXPORTED THE CLEANED DATA INTO CSV FILE FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND FURTHER PROCESSING.
  IN DATA ANALYSIS WE USED UNIVARITE,BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS AND EXPLORED THE DATA IN PLOTS.
  FINALLY WE DID THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION ON THE ABOVE DATA ANALYSIS.
